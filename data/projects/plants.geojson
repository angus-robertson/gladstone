The Demonstrator stage would have a total production capacity of up to 10,000 tonnes of renewable-based hydrogen per annum and 40,000 tonnes of (renewable-based) ammonia per annum.  Port Lincoln was the original project location. However, the redefined project has necessitated a change of location to Whyalla on the Eyre Peninsula. The project feasibility study has been completed, as well as site selection and preliminary planning activities. In September 2021, Worley was contracted to perform the front-end engineering design (FEED) studies for the Demonstrator stage of the project. The project will be later expanded to Export Stage, with a capacity of up to 2,400 tonnes per day of renewable-based ammonia production. In April 2021, RWE Supply and Trading and H2U announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to develop hydrogen trading links between Australia and Germany.

The primary focus of the project is to export liquid hydrogen to the Japanese market and supply hydrogen for ammonia production. The studies examine the complete hydrogen supply chain, including electrolysis, storage, handling, liquefaction, transportation and shipping. The project plans involve a phased development approach, with the first production targeted for 2028. By the early 2030s, the production capacity is expected to be scaled up to around 800 tonnes per day. To achieve this, 2 GW of electrolyser capacity will be used, requiring at least 7 GW of associated renewable solar/wind power generation capacity. In addition to the feasibility study, Stanwell will also undertake a study on the local workforce and manufacturing development. In February 2022, Stanwell Corporation and ACCIONA Energia announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for future energy supply to the proposed hydrogen facility. In April 2022, it was announced that the CQ-H2 hub development had received support through the Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hubs Program (Hub Implementation funding stream), amounting to up to AUD 69.2 million. The feasibility study was completed in June 2022, and after a period of bridging activities, the FEED study stage began in May 2023.

Bp Australia announced that it would cease fuel production at its Kwinana Refinery and convert the facility to an import terminal, helping to ensure the ongoing security of fuel supply for Western Australia. Following the project concept development phase, a public knowledge-sharing report was published in August 2023 that reported the outcomes of the technical feasibility assessment and a preliminary cost estimate. Three hydrogen production scenarios with various amounts of hydrogen production targets and electrolyser capacities have been considered. The technical evaluation noted that alkaline and PEM electrolysers should be further assessed to confirm the most appropriate technology. The water supply is proposed to be sourced from the Kwinana Water Reclamation Plant, while energy is sourced from a renewable-based power purchase agreement. The produced hydrogen would be used by bp, industrial consumers (especially within the Kwinana Industrial Area), tube trailer loading and mobility applications.

It is expected that the proposed facility would be supplied solely by new-build solar and wind resources. Development is planned for a 171 hectare site at Yarwun, within the Gladstone State Development Area, which is close to Fisherman’s Landing export precinct. This location facilitates the export of green hydrogen and ammonia from the Gladstone H2-HubTM to North Asia. In April 2022, H2U Group and Orica announced a strategic partnership agreement to support the initiation of the first phase of the proposed project. In November 2022, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed to develop value chains for green energy exports, with a focus on the potential use of renewable-based hydrogen in decarbonising Korea East West Power (EWP) power stations.

The renewable energy generated from wind and solar would be converted into hydrogen and ammonia for export. In October 2020, a Ministerial Statement approved the development proposal, subject to the implementation of the conditions and procedures included in the Statement. The first 15 GW of wind and solar power generation was approved, and this capacity is expected to grow further. The AREH will initially host up to 1,743 wind turbines (each up to 260 m), at least 2,000 MW of solar photovoltaic capacity, and will utilise seawater desalination to supply water for electrolysis. The project development envelope will extend approximately 668,100 hectares. Much of the renewable energy produced at the AREH will be converted into hydrogen and ammonia for export, with a provision of at least 3 GW of power generation capacity reserved for use in the Pilbara to enable large-scale mine electrification, replacement of imported diesel fuels with locally produced hydrogen, and the facilitation of mineral and metal processing and higher value exports. A new company town will also be constructed to accommodate the workforce required to build and run the AREH. Construction of the AREH has been planned in phases over approximately a decade, with the first final investment decision (FID) expected in 2025. In June 2022, BP announced it had formally become a project partner and operator. The first energy exports are anticipated to be in 2027/28.

The project would initially target 300 tonnes per day of hydrogen production, which can be converted into 600,000 tonnes per annum of ammonia or 110,000 tonnes per annum of liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen and ammonia would be produced using electrolysis, and natural gas reforming, with 100% of carbon emissions abated or offset. The electrolysis component of H2Perth's production will have an initial capacity of 250 MW, potentially scaling to more than 3 GW. The initial phase of the steam methane reformer will consume 40 terajoules per day of natural gas. In December 2021, it was announced that Woodside, Keppel Data Centres, City Energy, Osaka Gas Singapore and City-OG Gas Energy Services would collaborate to explore the technical and commercial aspects of developing a liquid hydrogen supply chain between Western Australia and Singapore, and potentially Japan.

Hydrogen will be produced through PEM electrolysis, with Siemens proposing use of their modern electrolyser technology, Siemens Silyzer (approximately 3000 MW of electrolysis). The project is expected to produce up to 385,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2030. HRA has developed plans for the Murchison Renewable Hydrogen Project that will be undertaken in three core phases: i. a demonstration phase for the production of transport fuels; ii. producing hydrogen fuels for natural gas blending into the nearby Dampier to Bunbury pipeline; and iii. large-scale expansion of production for export. In November 2020, it was announced that Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners would partner with HRA to develop the project.

The study aimed to provide hydrogen for embedded co-generation at various precincts within the City. The study results suggested that the project was best delivered in stages. The study's detailed analysis focused on Stage 1 – hydrogen refuelling of the City of Cockburn's waste collection vehicle fleet.\nFurther use of hydrogen in the City's light vehicle fleet and as embedded co-generation at the Aquatic and Recreation Centre was proposed as (expansion) Stages 2 and 3, respectively but not examined in depth. Key Stage 1 design features included a 1.2 MW solar field, 1.25 MW electrolyser capable of producing 440 kg/day of hydrogen, 1,000 kg of hydrogen storage and AUD24.5 million as a capital cost. The study notes that the engineering work performed confirms that there are no technical barriers to developing projects of this kind in Australia.

The study included an evaluation of different technologies and process required to manufacture renewable hydrogen and ‘green’ ammonia as well as domestic and export renewable ammonia/hydrogen market potential and opportunities/barriers to scale up. The potential demonstration plant investigated would aim to produce approximately 20,000 tonnes of renewable ammonia per year (using renewable hydrogen production capacity through electrolysis of around 4,000 tonnes per annum). The study also indicated grid-sourced renewable power (via a power purchase agreement) as the preferred means of power supply to meet the project load requirement of 35.4 megawatts (MW). Primary hydrogen production would be achieved by a combination of Alkaline and PEM electrolysers. On 11 August 2021, bp Australia announced the findings of its study into the feasibility of an export-scale green \u200Ehydrogen and ammonia production facility in Western Australia.

The facility will feature an initial 36 MW electrolyser capacity and will be located approximately 100 kilometers south of Perth. The water required for the electrolysis process will be sourced from underground (bore) sources. Additionally, the project includes the development of around 50 tonnes of hydrogen storage capacity. Various end uses are currently being evaluated, including hydrogen utilisation in gas networks, power generation, energy storage, industrial feedstock, and transportation applications. The project proponent is also conducting multiple work streams focusing on solar, wind, and battery energy storage. These efforts aim to assess the potential for increasing power generation capacity to over 500 MW. In September 2023, the proponent completed pre-FEED studies for the hydrogen production facilities and published its Definitive Feasibility Study report. Frontier Energy Limited is targeting FID in 2023 for the overall Bristol Springs development.

The project focuses on supplying hydrogen for mobility purposes, with power use options also under examination. Infinite Green Energy designs the project to have the capacity to produce up to 42 tonnes per day of renewables-based hydrogen to supply domestic Australian markets. In mid-2022, the project proponent submitted its environmental impact assessment to the Western Australia Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) for the HP1 project. Key features of the Referral include:\n- solar farm (minimum 65 MW to maximum 85 MW generation capacity)\n- wind turbines (22 minimum to 25 maximum x 6 MW generation capacity)\n- water supply (groundwater)\n- processing plant output (maximum production extent 23 tonnes per day to 42 tonnes per day)\n- storage and offloading (20 MW battery storage). \nOnce commissioned, the plant would produce liquified compressed hydrogen utilising site groundwater, with the final product transported via hydrogen-fuelled road tankers to end users. The project is expected to come online in late 2025 and will serve the domestic Western Australian energy and transport markets. Infinite Green Energy is in discussing securing strategic partner for the arrowsmith development, including its expansion to 2.5 GW of renewable energy.

The project is designed to produce and potentially consume significant quantities of renewables-based hydrogen feedstock. While the primary source of feedstock for the ammonia/urea facilities at start-up is natural gas from the South Erregulla field, the project includes integrating an on-site 10 megawatt (MW) electrolyser with the capacity to produce around 1,825 tonnes per annum of renewables-based hydrogen. The electrolyser is planned to be powered from nearby wind and solar power or potentially by Strike Energy’s geothermal resources in the Perth Basin, should appraisal of its mid-west Geothermal Power Project prove successful. The project proponent has commenced Front End Engineering Design (FEED) early works, primarily focused on environmental approvals and consolidating the FEED basis of design.

The project involves the installation of a 27MW Wathagar Solar Farm and an electrolyser with a 12 MW capacity on the 'Keytah' agricultural proerty near Moree. The solar farm will generate energy for the seasonal ginning perations, feed excess electricity into the electricity grid, and provide power for a renewables-based electrolysis facility. The produced hydrogen will replace diesel used in regional transport operations and for the production of (anhydrous) ammonia for use at ‘Keytah’ and other regional properties.

Direct capture of CO2 from the atmosphere will also be assessed. The project would deploy a 120 to 260 MW electrolysis plant to produce renewable-based hydrogen. Most hydrogen would act as feedstock (along with CO2) to enable renewables-based production of methanol for domestic use and export. Part of the hydrogen produced would also be available for domestic use.

The feasibility study evaluated the opportunity to replace a portion of the hydrogen produced through the steam methane reformation (SMR) process with hydrogen produced via electrolysis powered by onsite solar PV. This includes developing a plant to serve as a demonstration project for larger-scale renewable hydrogen development. The objective of the demonstration project is that the renewable-based hydrogen produced via electrolysis, equivalent to approximately 625 tonnes of hydrogen per year, would be blended into the SMR-produced hydrogen. Forecast avoided emissions from the existing SMR hydrogen production process is around 6,500 tonnes per annum (CO2-eq. per annum). The commercial demonstration plant (designated ‘Phase 0’) considers the application of a 10 MW electrolyser powered by a dedicated solar PV farm of approximately 18 MW peak, with the project facilities covering an area of over 20 hectares. The study also evaluated the use of seawater for the electrolyser. Commercial options for the sale of the oxygen produced via the electrolysis process are under evaluation. The demonstration plant would be located adjacent to the existing Yara facilities within the Burrup Strategic Industrial Area (SIA), approximately 11 km northwest of Karratha. In early May 2021, ENGIE was announced as a recipient of a conditional funding award of AUD$42.5 million under the above Funding Round.

                "description": "Hydrogen Fuels Australia is developing modular hydrogen production and refuelling facilities at a five hectare site in Truganina, near the Melbourne suburb of Laverton, in Victoria. The modular nature of the overall energy system allows the installed equipment to be relocated to another site without leaving an environmental footprint at the location being exited.  The Truganina site is planned to host multiple commercial entities servicing the needs of the local community. The electricity (micro-grid) requirements of these entities would be met by an onsite solar energy array coupled with a hydrogen production and storage system. The site would also host a hydrogen refuelling station to allow for use of produced hydrogen in mobility purposes (e.g. buses). The site would be self-contained with sole reliance on the onsite integrated energy production/distribution system. The project includes the following key items such as installation of 750 kW solar array, alkaline electrolyser (432kW), hydrogen fuel cell (95kW), hydrogen storage tanks (300kg capacity onsite, and 900kg transported in), hydrogen compressor matched to electrolyser capacity and 100% renewable-powered hydrogen production facility. Subject to permitting approvals, the project is expected to be operational in 2024. Initially, the hydrogen refuelling station would be able to fuel 2-3 vehicles per day. In the long run, the proponent indicates that the site can be upscaled to supply up to 6,500 kg of hydrogen per day, with capacity to fuel more than 100 vehicles per day.

The facility comprises a 1.25 kW alkaline electrolyser producing renewable hydrogen gas powered by solar panels. The facility has three main objectives to be progressed across three phases: Phase 1 - test existing ACT network components (e.g. distribution piping and valves) and construction and maintenance practices under 100 % hydrogen application; Phase 2 - test hydrogen as a broader energy storage source to support a coupling of the electricity and gas networks; and Phase 3 - test appliances, and associated piping, regulators, and meters, with different blends of hydrogen and natural gas to gauge how different equipment performs on different blends. The facility is also used to train gas-fitting students in these new technologies and to equip tradespeople with skills for the emerging hydrogen industry.

The facility, which is co-located with ActewAGL’s former compressed natural gas (CNG) refuelling station, serves 20 Hyundai Nexo fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) operated by the ACT Government. An additional small number of private FCEV users also have access to the refuelling station. The hydrogen refuelling station pilot uses renewable electricity sourced from the grid (which is 100 % renewable in the ACT) to produce hydrogen onsite using a Nel Hydrogen Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyser. The facility produces up to 21 kg of hydrogen per day, with the produced hydrogen compressed and stored in three tanks (all held at different pressures) which together can hold 44 kg of hydrogen (and from which the hydrogen is drawn during fuelling).

This project aims to decarbonise the energy supply of the Korea Zinc group globally, and has received a AUD5 million grant from the Queensland Government’s Hydrogen Industry Development Fund. Phase 1 of SunHQ will involve a 1MW PEM electrolyser, which will produce green hydrogen from a behind-the-meter connection to the co-located 124MWac Sun Metals solar farm. Compression, storage, and refuelling facilities will be located adjacent to the electrolyser. Ark Energy will use five new hydrogen fuel cell heavy haulage trucks (each 140 tonnes capacity) from Hyzon Motors and lease them to its sister company Townsville Logistics Pty Ltd for its short-haul fleet operating between the Port of Townsville and the Sun Metals refinery (25km round-trip). Phase 2 of the project will look at expanding the electrolyser capacity of SunHQ up to 150MW and exploring opportunities to build additional hydrogen hubs in Queensland. Further project phases would seek to expand on the domestic market and develop export opportunities for green hydrogen into Korea. In September 2021, Ark Energy and the Port of Townsville signed a Memorandum of Understanding to undertake a feasibility study on developing a renewable hydrogen facility focused on the transport industry at the Sun Metals zinc refinery in Townsville, along with hydrogen export facilities at the Port of Townsville. More fundings was announced in March 2022, which consisted of AUD3 million of conditional approval from ARENA and a commitment up to AUD12.5 million from CEFC.

This demonstration plant will provide proof of concept that hydrogen can be produced from solar energy and water extracted from the air, and then converted into methane using CO2 also extracted from the air. The plant will produce approximately 620 kg of methane per year, which will be converted into 35 GJ of renewable methane and injected into APA's compression fuel gas line. The CO2 extracted from the atmosphere offsets the CO2 emitted when the methane is used, leading to carbon-neutral energy generation. The system also incorporates hydrogen storage which would allow production of renewable methane on a continual basis. Power for the plant will be provided by a newly built on-site solar system comprising of 10 kW of solar PV panels. The project will also generate cost and technical data to be used to assess the feasibility of a larger, commercial scale renewable methane concept system. APA has partnered with Southern Green Gas to develop the AUD 2.2 million project, with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) providing AUD1.1\u202Fmillion towards the project.

                "description": "Horizon Power, the Western Australian Government’s regional and remote power provider, is investigating the potential development of a hydrogen demonstration plant in the small coastal town of Denham, Western Australia. Horizon Power presently supplies power to Denham’s 750 permanent residents through a combined wind generation and diesel system, with wind generation supplying around 30 % of demand. Currently, Horizon Power supplies power to Denham's 750 permanent residents through a combined wind generation and diesel system, with wind generation meeting around 30% of the demand. However, both components of the system are reaching the end of their operational lives. Therefore, Horizon Power is proposing the construction of a hydrogen demonstration plant that would work alongside the upgraded power solution for Denham. The plant is expected to use solar energy as its power source, although wind energy is also being considered. The demonstration plant will include a 348 kW electrolyser, hydrogen storage tanks (300 Bar, 3477 Nm3), a 100 kW hydrogen fuel cell, and a 2-stage hydrogen compressor. Excess energy from the solar farm, and potentially wind farm, will power the electrolyser to produce hydrogen. This hydrogen will be stored and later converted back to electricity when needed, mainly during night-time, using a fuel cell. This integrated system will enable Denham's energy needs to be fully met by renewable sources. The energy generated from the solar farm and hydrogen demonstration plant will provide enough renewable energy to meet the average energy requirements of approximately 100 residential customers in Denham. In April 2023, ARENA announced the release of the project report titled \"Horizon Power Denham Hydrogen Demonstration Lessons Learnt 1 & 2.\" This report outlines the technical viability of incorporating renewable hydrogen power systems into a microgrid.

                "description": "Hazer Group is embarking on a world-first project to turn biogas from sewage into hydrogen and graphite. The facility will use biogas sourced from a wastewater treatment plant to produce 100 tonnes per year of hydrogen and 380 tonnes per year of synthetic graphite. Using the Hazer process of methane cracking, the facility will convert sewerage biogas into renewable hydrogen and high-quality, synthetic graphite. This process offers distinct advantages over existing hydrogen production methods. Hazer's key differentiators are its use of low-cost iron-ore as the catalyst and the ability to create a significant carbon abatement ('carbon negative') when using biogas as a feedstock. In addition, the project scope will include a stationary hydrogen fuel-cell power generation system, which will allow the plant to generate its renewable power by using some of the produced hydrogen. Plant commissioning is now anticipated after construction and installation of the initial carbon steel cold reactor planned by mid-2022. The production operation is expected to commence in the second half of 2023.

The refuelling station is to be located at CSIRO’s Clayton campus in Melbourne, Victoria and is a key milestone in developing CSIRO’s Hydrogen Industry Mission. Construction of the station will take place as part of the development of VH2, expected in early 2022, and will include a new hydrogen production and storage demonstration facility (either on-board at the refueller station or within the ‘Hydrogen Technology Demonstration Facility', to which the refueller station is attached). Hydrogen production capacity is planned at approximately 20 kg per day (PEM electrolyser). The refuelling station is anticipated to be operational in the third quarter of 2023. Power for the electrolysers and facilities would be sourced from renewable energy via a power purchase agreement (PPA) supplemented by an onsite solar generation deployed across the CSIRO Clayton site in 2020. The refuelling station will include a CSIRO fleet trial of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, with the potential for further collaborative trials with additional project partners.

The power-to-gas facility injects up to 2 % volume of hydrogen gas into the Sydney secondary gas distribution network and will supply hydrogen to a microturbine to generate electricity for export back to the grid. Hydrogen gas is produced using a 500 kW PEM electrolyser and purchased solar and wind energy and  stored onsite in an underground buffer store and Jemena's gas network. The facility is located at Jemena's Horsley Park Transfer Receiving Station in Western Sydney and has a production capacity of 10 kg per hour of hydrogen gas. In November 2021, the project began blending of hydrogen into the gas network and is anticipated to operate for around five years.

The building is powered by a 376 kW solar array consisting of 1164 photovoltaic panels on the roof and window awnings. On sunny days, these panels produce more than enough electricity to power the building, and excess energy is stored overnight in lithium-ion batteries, and for longer periods as hydrogen. Excess solar electricity powers a 160 kW alkaline electrolyser, which splits water to produce hydrogen at a rate of 30 Normal cubic metres (2.7 kg) per hour. The hydrogen is stored as a metal hydride. This custom-manufactured storage system has a capacity of 120 kg of hydrogen, equivalent to 2 MWh of electricty, making it the largest metal-hydride storage unit in the world in civil use. Electricity is produced from stored hydrogen by two 30 kW PEM fuel cells. The hydrogen storage allows the building to operate around the clock for several days in dull or rainy weather.

Renewable hydrogen is produced using a Siemens 1.25 MW PEM electrolyser, which utilises renewable electricity from the South Australian electricity network.  Initially, a 5% renewable gas blend was supplied through the existing gas network to over 700 households in the nearby suburb of Mitchell Park. HyP SA has also installed tube-trailer filling facilities that enable the road transport of hydrogen, allowing it to be blended into other points in the network, including hydrogen vehicle refuelling stations and industrial applications.\nIn October 2020, BOC announced an offtake agreement to purchase excess hydrogen produced by HyP SA. BOC has also installed a compressor to facilitate the transport of hydrogen via tube trailers to industrial customers in South Australia, with potential expansion to Western Australia. The first commercial delivery of renewable hydrogen from the HyP SA facility to BOC's plant in Whyalla, South Australia, took place in August 2022. By March 2023, the delivery of 5% blended renewable hydrogen had expanded to include approximately 3,000 additional residential and commercial properties.

Developing large-scale, renewable hydrogen production facilities would initially service domestic markets and then scale into potential export avenues through technology demonstration projects. A specific objective of the Net Zero Industry and Innovation Program is to develop hydrogen hubs in the Hunter and Illawarra/Port Kembla, which will be supported by AUD 150 million of State grant funding. The NSW Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) under the Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap will also support the development of green hydrogen hubs. The development of a hydrogen hub in the Hunter region can benefit from the existing energy, related industries, and associated infrastructure and skills in the area (including ports and logistics capabilities). The NSW Government is facilitating discussions among stakeholders to progress the concept of a hydrogen hub in the Hunter region. In the first stage of 2022, the NSW Government noted that more than AUD4 billion in potential investment proposals was received in response to the Stage 1 competitive funding process for commercial-scale green hydrogen projects. Two projects in the Illawarra/Port Kembla region are progressing with hydrogen-related project activities.

The second stage is the development of a clean hydrogen project based on partial oxidation/gas heated reforming with CCS. Hydrogen production through this means is initially targeted at around 40,000 tonnes per annum with expansions targeted. The third stage will integrate renewables-based hydrogen production and expand sales by targeting export-focused ammonia shipments.

The region provides an optimal diurnal profile for renewable energy, with consistently high levels of wind and solar energy over a 24-hour period. WGEH will be built in phases to produce up to 3.5 million tons of zero-carbon green hydrogen or 20 million tons of green ammonia each year. The output would supply both domestic and export markets as the ‘green fuels’ market continues to expand post-2030.

The energy source for producing hydrogen would come from a solar farm in Kununurra (in development with approximately 1 GW capacity) and an existing hydroelectric Ord Hydro Power Plant (30 MW) at Lake Argyle (70 km south of Kununurra). Fresh water from Lake Kununnura would provide the water required for the electrolysis process. The hydrogen produced would then be transported (through buried pipeline) for 120 km to Balanggarra Country in Wyndham for ammonia production. The produced ammonia would be used domestically as well as export to nearby Asian market.
